# Java-Break
Taking breaks is an important part of daily life. First of all, having regular breaks can reduce or prevent even from being stressed. Secondly, it is important to have breaks during work time, because it can improve the overall process and help to concentrate easier. Furthermore, taking a break to stretch after a long time of sitting by your computer, can help you stay healthy and will also give your eyes a needed break.

Having this in mind I decided to create an application that would help to improve daily life and make it easier for people to track their break times. 
For the current solutions, there is no efficient way to keep track of when to take a break, because there is no integrated tool in android. For the alternative, it is possible to set a bunch of alarm clocks, but it is impractical. Already existing applications with a similar concept are missing intuitive design, include millions of ads or are paid, and are outdated.

Java Break; application includes all useful features with a user-friendly interface. A user can choose between two different types of breaks:  productive (sets break remainder for selected time interval) and daily (sets break reminder intervals for the selected day of the week and time). A User will able to choose from the different options of getting a notification: sound, vibration, led. At the same time, the user will get a message with useful information to stay healthy.
